Distributed as part of {ehtm}, {ey} is a separate, stand-alone, self-container CLI (command-line interface) that allows {es} to run (and thus be managed) within a http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html[YARN] environment. 

In other words, {es} can use YARN to allocate its resources and be started and stopped, on said resources, through YARN infrastructure.
